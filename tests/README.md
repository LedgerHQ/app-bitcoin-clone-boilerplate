Python dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), install them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to create the necessary binaries for the Bitcoin Testnet application, you can must first compile the binairies

Then run all the tests using:

```
pytest --device all
```

## Launch with your device
